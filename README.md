A simple index of documents

## Prelude

This project is a remake of the one I made while I was in university coursing the Information Retrieval.

The aim was put in practice the basics of what we were learning like stopwords, synonyms, stemming, scores, indexing, etc.

The initial idea was to index all the theses produced by the students of UFCG.

## Tools

I used Rails + Sunspot that are pretty useful for small and simple projects like this one.

I also used Docsplit that depends on *pdftotext* to parse the documents to extract the content.

## TODO

Better description
